# Implementations of OGC API - EDR

## Overview

This page points to servers and clients implementing the OGC API - Environmental Data Retrieval standard.

Modern web browsers can, of course, act as clients.

To help promote OGC API standards and their implementations, implementers of OGC API standards are encouraged to register their implementations on the Programmable Web API Directory (https://www.programmableweb.com/add/api), in addition to registering at the OGC Compliance Database (https://www.ogc.org/resource/products/registration). 

These are the implementations that were used for the development of the standard:
1. [UK Met Office, Mark Burgoyne](http://labs.metoffice.gov.uk/edr2/)              [Further details](#Implementation1)
1. [US NWS, Shane Mill](https://data-api.mdl.nws.noaa.gov/EDR-API)       Further details
1. [IBL, Igor Andruska](https://ogcie.iblsoft.com/edr)      Further details
1. [Wuhan University, Peng Yue](http://geos.whu.edu.cn/whu-edr-demo/)       Further details
1. Pete Trevelyan, ESRI Image Server facade      Further details
1. [USGS, Dave Blodgett, Monitoring Networks wiki page mockup](https://github.com/opengeospatial/Environmental-Data-Retrieval-API/wiki/Monitoring-network-mockup)      Further details

Further implementations are planned or have been proposed for 2021: 
1. Unidata OpenDAP/THREDDS enhancement
1. NASA/JPL enhancement to Extensible Data Gateway Environment (EDGE)

Several other organisations, such as the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECWMF), British Antarctic Survey (BAS)
and the British Oceanographic Data Centre (BODC) and others, are currently waiting until the full formal standard is published.
