== Requirements classes for encodings

=== Overview

This clause specifies two pre-defined requirements classes for encodings to be used by an OGC API implementation. These encodings are commonly used encodings for spatial data on the web:

* <<rc_html-section,HTML>>
* <<rc_geojson-section,GeoJSON>>

Neiter of these encodings are mandatory and an implementation of the <<rc_core-section,Core>> requirements class may implement either, both, or none of them. <<overview,Clause 7 (Overview)>> includes a discussion about recommended encodings.

[[rc_html-section]]
=== Requirement Class "HTML"

Geographic information that is only accessible in formats like GeoJSON or GML has two issues:

* The data is not discoverable using the most common mechanism for discovering information, that is the search engines of the Web,
* The data can not be viewed directly in a browser - additional tools are required to view the data.

Therefore, sharing data on the Web should include publication in HTML. To be consistent with the Web, it should be done in a way that enables users and search engines to access all data.

This is discussed in detail in <<SDWBP,W3C Best Practice>>. This standard therefore <<rec_html,recommends>> supporting HTML as an encoding.

The HTML conformance class is defined in API-Common. The API-EDR standard implements that HTML conformance class without modification.

[[rc_geojson-section]]
=== Requirement Class "GeoJSON"

GeoJSON is a commonly used format that is simple to understand and well supported by tools and software libraries. Since most Web developers are comfortable with using a JSON-based format, supporting GeoJSON is recommended if the resource can be represented in GeoJSON for the intended use.

The GeoJSON conformance class is defined in API-Common. The API-EDR standard extends that GeoJSON conformance class.

NOTE: The following schema names are from API-Features and need to be updated.

Templates for the definition of the schemas for the GeoJSON responses in JSON Schema definitions are available at link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opengeospatial/oapi_common/master/standard/openapi/schemas/collections.yaml[collections.yaml] and link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opengeospatial/oapi_common/master/standard/openapi/schemas/collectionInfo.yaml[collectionInfo.yaml].

These are generic schemas that do not include any application schema information about specific resource types or their properties.
