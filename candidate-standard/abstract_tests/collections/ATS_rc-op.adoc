^|*Abstract Test {counter:ats-id}* |*/ats/collections/rc-op*
^|Test Purpose |Validate that resources can be identified and extracted from a Collection using query parameters.
^|Requirement |<<req_collections_rc-op,/req/collections/rc-op>>
^|Test Method |. For every resource collection identified in Collections, issue an HTTP GET request to the URL `/collections/{collectionId}/items` where `{collectionId}` is the `id` property for a Collection described in the Collections content.
. Validate that a document was returned with a status code 200.

Repeat these tests using the following parameter tests:

*Bounding Box:*

* Parameter <<ats_collections_rc-bbox-definition,/ats/collections/rc-bbox-definition>>
* Response <<ats_collections_rc-bbox-response,/ats/collections/rc-bbox-response>>

*DateTime:*

* Parameter <<ats_collections_rc-time-definition,/ats/collections/rc-time-definition>>
* Response <<ats_collections_rc-time-response,/ats/collections/rc-time-response>>

Execute requests with combinations of the "bbox" and "datetime" query parameters
and verify that only features are returned that match both selection criteria.
