^|*Abstract Test {counter:ats-id}* |*/ats/locations*

^|Test Method |. Test with valid query parameters
. Validate that a document was returned with a status code 200.

Repeat these tests using the following parameter tests:

*Parameters*
* Parameter <<../../requirements/collections/edr/REQ_rc-parameter-definition,/ats/collections/rc-parametername-definition>>
* Response <<../../requirements/collections/edr/REQ_rc-parameter-response,/ats/collections/rc-parametername-response>>

*DateTime*

* Parameter <<../../requirements/collections/edr/REQ_rc-time-definition,/ats/collections/rc-time-definition>>
* Response <<../../requirements/collections/edr/REQ_rc-time-response,/ats/collections/rc-time-response>>

Execute requests with combinations of the "time","parametername","crs" and "outputformat" query parameters
and verify that only information that matches the selection criteria is returned.
