== Scope

This specification identifies resources, captures compliance classes, and specifies requirements which are applicable to all OGC EDR API's.  It should be included as a normative reference by all such standards.

This specification addresses two fundamental operations; discovery and query.

Discovery operations allow the API to be interrogated to determine its capabilities and retrieve information (metadata) about this distribution of a resource. This includes the API definition of the server as well as metadata about the spatial resources provided by the server.

Query operations allow spatial resources to be retrieved from the underlying data store based upon simple selection criteria, defined by the client.
