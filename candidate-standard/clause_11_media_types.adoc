== Media Types

JSON media types that would typically be used in an OGC API that supports JSON are:

* `application/prs.coverage+json` for resources that include coverage content, and
* `application/geo+json` for feature collections and features, and
* `application/json` for all other resources.

XML media types that would typically occur in on OGC API that supports XML are

* `application/gml+xml;version=3.2` for any GML 3.2 feature collections and features,
* `application/gml+xml;version=3.2;profile=http://www.opengis.net/def/profile/ogc/2.0/gml-sf0` for GML 3.2 feature collections and features conforming to the GML Simple Feature Level 0 profile,
* `application/gml+xml;version=3.2;profile=http://www.opengis.net/def/profile/ogc/2.0/gml-sf2` for GML 3.2 feature collections and features conforming to the GML Simple Feature Level 2 profile, and
* `application/xml` for all other resources.

The typical HTML media type for all "web pages" in an OGC API would be `text/html`.

The media types for an OpenAPI definition are `vnd.oai.openapi+json;version=3.0` (JSON) and `application/vnd.oai.openapi;version=3.0` (YAML).
